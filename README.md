## BDD
This is a simple dice game where two players have the chance to roll the dice to try and achieve a score of 100. Each player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold".

The rules of the game are:

* When a player rolls a 1, their total score reverts to 0 and it becomes the next player's turn.
* When the player rolls a 2 - 6, the score is added to their turn total and they can continue to play
* When the player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their total score, and it becomes the next player's turn.
* The player who first scores 100 or more points wins.
